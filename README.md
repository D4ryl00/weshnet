# Wesh Network Toolkit

[![go.dev reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white)](https://pkg.go.dev/berty.tech/weshnet)

The Wesh network toolkit lets your application use the
[Wesh protocol](https://berty.tech/docs/protocol) to support privacy-based, off-grid, peer-to-peer communication.
Wesh powers [Berty Messenger](https://github.com/berty/berty#readme), and now you can use
the Wesh network toolkit directly.

Your application interfaces to Wesh based on [gRPC](https://grpc.io). So even though
the core Wesh code is written in Go, Wesh works with your application written in Go, Python
or [other languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages) supported by gRPC.

For details, see the Wesh website at https://wesh.network .
The website includes [blog tutorials](https://wesh.network/blog) which introduce you to
Wesh and walk you through some example applications and background of the Wesh protocol.
