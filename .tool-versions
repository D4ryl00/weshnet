# @TODO(gfanton): check if we still have this issue
# The current version of golangci-lint also has a problem displaying logs on
# Github actions, see: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/issues/119
#
# It would be good to update it (when possible) to a version that fixes this log
# issue and to update the golangci-lint Github Actions step accordingly.
